Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of writing instructions(requests,prompts) to guide AI to produce specific responses
It is important while interacting with AI models because well engineered prompts helps the AI models produce more accurate and relevant responses. They also help the AI models to
interact more meaningfully with users. The quality of the responses from the AI models is dependent on the quality of the prompts. The prompts should be clear and specific

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt: "Tell me something about politics"
Improved Prompt: "Tell me in summary, the nature of politics in Kenya")
The improved prompt will be more effective because the AI responses will be tailored around the political nature of a specific country; Kenya as opposed to general information on politics that could be retrieved anywhere in the world.
