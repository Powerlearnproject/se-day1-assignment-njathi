#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the development, design, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It is important in the technology industry because it promotes growth and innovation, improves efficiency and productivity through autommation, enhances security and data protection, derives economy and industrial development, ensures the development of high quality software. Software engineering also facilitates collaboration and scalability. Methodologies like Agile and DevOps promote teamwork and continuous improvement.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) â€“ NATO Conference
This milestone arose from the "software crisis", where developers struggled with software that was expensive, error-prone, and difficult to maintain.
The conference emphasized structured programming, formal methods, and software development methodologies to improve software quality and reliability.

2. The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s)
Introduced by Edsger Dijkstra, structured programming promoted the use of logical control structures such as loops and conditionals instead of unstructured "goto" statements.
Key methodologies like Waterfall Model (proposed by Winston Royce in 1970) provided a structured, step-by-step approach to software development.
This milestone improved readability, maintainability, and reduced errors in software development.

3. The Agile Revolution (2001) â€“ Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto was published by a group of software developers who sought a more flexible and iterative approach to software development.
Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban replaced rigid, document-heavy models like Waterfall.
Agile focuses on continuous delivery, customer collaboration, and adaptability, making software development more responsive to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement Analysis
Understanding and documenting the needs of stakeholders.
Identifying functional and non-functional requirements.
2. Planning
Defining the project scope, budget, timeline, and resources.
Risk analysis and feasibility study to assess project viability.

3. Design
Creating architectural diagrams, database models, and system components.

4. Development (Coding & Implementation)
Writing and implementing code based on design specifications.
Using programming languages, frameworks, and development tools.

5. Testing
Conducting functional, performance, security, and user acceptance testing.
Identifying and fixing bugs to ensure software quality.

6. Deployment
Releasing the software to users or production environments.

7. Maintenance & Support
Fixing issues, providing updates, and enhancing features.
Ensuring long-term functionality and security.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is Sequential, step-by-step while Agile	Iterative and incremental
Waterfall isRigid; difficult to make changes after a phase is completed, Agile is	Highly flexible; changes can be made at any stage
Development Speed is	Slower in waterfall due to structured phases and	Faster in agile due to continuous iterations
Customer Involvement is	Limited to the initial requirements phase and final product review while there's	Continuous feedback and involvement in agile
Testing is	Performed after development is completed for waterfall while in agile is ongoing throughout the development cycle
Documentation	is extensive before development in watrerfall and there's minimal documentation for agile, focusing on working software
Waterfall is best for	Projects with well-defined, stable requirements, while agile is best suited for projects with evolving or unclear requirements
Examples	
WaterfLL: Large infrastructure projects, Government systems 
Agile: 	Mobile apps, startups, and dynamic web applications

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of writing instructions(requests,prompts) to guide AI to produce specific responses
It is important while interacting with AI models because well engineered prompts helps the AI models produce more accurate and relevant responses. They also help the AI models to
interact more meaningfully with users. The quality of the responses from the AI models is dependent on the quality of the prompts. The prompts should be clear and specific

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A vague prompt: "Tell me something about politics"
Improved Prompt: "Tell me in summary, the nature of politics in Kenya")
The improved prompt will be more effective because the AI responses will be tailored around the political nature of a specific country; Kenya as opposed to general information on politics that could be retrieved anywhere in the world.
